uas task for round 2

2 OCTOBER 2024
I downloaded Ubuntu  but was getting some issues in opencv 
So I switched to windows 

3 OCTOBER 2024
Today I started doing my task
I have done the basics of opencv by the video  (  https://youtu.be/oXlwWbU8l2o?si=aV4NdlhGLxLru7Li ) (I have not completed the full video) today 
Then I started my task

thought of converting bgr to hsv then to do masking since it is more efficient but in hsv image everything was of same colour so i rejected it
then i did masking using bgr and i also used median blur for more accuracy
but I was not able to get the colour range 
So I asked gunmay bhaiya then he gave me the solution 
Till now I have just made the grassy area with different colour
